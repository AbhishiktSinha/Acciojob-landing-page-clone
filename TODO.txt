MEDIA QUERIES

Bootstrap provides some commonly used breakpoints for different screen sizes. Here they are:

1. Extra small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px): No media query is required since this is the default in Bootstrap.
2. Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up): @media (min-width: 576px) {...}
3. Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up): @media (min-width: 768px) {...}
4. Large devices (desktops, 992px and up): @media (min-width: 992px) {...}
5. Extra large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up): @media (min-width: 1200px) {...}

Some commonly used breakpoints for different devices:

1. Small devices (mobile phones): Less than 600px. This is the point at which you would start to specifically style for mobile devices.
2. Medium devices (tablets): 600px and up. This is where you would start to style for tablets and similar medium-sized devices.
3. Large devices (laptops, desktops): 992px and up. This is where you would start to style for larger screens.
4. Extra large devices (large desktops, TVs): 1200px and up. This is where you would start to style for very large screens.
